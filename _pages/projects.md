### Home security system
- Built a security system using motion sensors to detect any motion, microcontroller (Arduino uno) to control all the components used in the system, GSM module used to send message to the property owner and lighting system to light up when a motion is detected (automated).

### Using Wireshark to view Traffic.
-Provided hands-on experience in capturing and analysing network packets using
Wireshark. By using Wireshark I gained insight into how data travels across a network and how
devices communicate using IP and MAC addresses.

### DNS Requests â€“ Hack The Box Academy Lab
-Using the nslookup command-line utility on a TryHackMe virtual machine, I performed several DNS queries on the domain website.thm and its subdomains. Each query was aimed at retrieving a specific type of DNS record to understand its purpose and the kind of information it can reveal.

### Build a switch and router Network
-Through the configuration of router interfaces, switch VLANs, IP addressing (both IPv4 and IPv6), and verification with ping and show commands, I was able to observe how data travels across networks and subnets. The exercise highlighted the importance of accurate addressing, interface status, and proper use of default gateways. Additionally, it underscored key troubleshooting techniques for common issues like incorrect IP settings or down interfaces. Overall, the lab provided a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical environment, solidifying essential networking skills.
