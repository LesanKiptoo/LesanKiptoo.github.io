### Build a switch and router Network.
Through the configuration of router interfaces, switch VLANs, IP addressing (both IPv4 and IPv6), and verification with ping and show commands, I was able to observe how data travels across networks and subnets. The exercise highlighted the importance of accurate addressing, interface status, and proper use of default gateways. Additionally, it underscored key troubleshooting techniques for common issues like incorrect IP settings or down interfaces. Overall, the lab provided a valuable opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical environment, solidifying essential networking skills.

### Use Wireshark to view Traffic.
- Provided hands-on experience in capturing and analysing network packets using
Wireshark. By using Wireshark I gained insight into how data travels across a network and how
devices communicate using IP and MAC addresses.

### TryHackMe Lab- Domain in Detail.
- Using the nslookup command-line utility on a TryHackMe virtual machine, I performed several DNS queries on the domain website.thm and its subdomains. Each query was aimed at retrieving a specific type of DNS record to understand its purpose and the kind of information it can reveal.

### Hack the box- Web Requests
- The Web Requests lab provided hands-on experience with interacting directly with API endpoints using HTTP methods. It reinforced the practical use of curl for testing and manipulating web requests and demonstrated how client-server communication is structured in RESTful APIs. By completing the CRUD operations and successfully retrieving the flag, I deepened my understanding of web mechanics, which is essential for both secure web development and penetration testing. This foundational knowledge will be instrumental as I progress into more advanced topics.
